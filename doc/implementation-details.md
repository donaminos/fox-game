# Implementation details

This version of the Fox Game is built on top of the original workshop project from Frontend Masters, with additional enhancements and explanations to make it better, more maintainable, and scalable. The goal is to provide an improved learning experience and create a solid foundation for further development and experimentation.

## Enhancements

- [TypeScript Integration](#TypeScript)

## TypeScript

In this enhanced version of the Fox Game, I introduced TypeScript to the project. TypeScript adds static types, enabling a more robust development experience with improved tooling, error-checking, and code maintainability.

By incorporating TypeScript into the Fox Game, we aim to provide a more reliable and scalable codebase, making it easier to understand, refactor, and extend the game's functionality.

This enhancement will not only improve code quality and readability but also help developers catch potential errors and bugs during development, resulting in a more stable and enjoyable gaming experience for users. Additionally, TypeScript's static typing will lead to better editor support and autocompletion, streamlining the development process and making it more efficient for both new and experienced contributors.
